# Heart Disease Classification using Logistic regression 

## Dataset Overview
- The dataset contains information about individuals' health.
- Features include age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and more.

## Data Preprocessing
- Checked for missing values: Found missing values in the 'Ca' and 'Thal' columns.
- Replaced missing values with appropriate values or methods.

## Data Exploration
- Checked unique values in each column.
- Performed data scaling using Min-Max scaling for specific columns (e.g., 'Grad_Rate', 'Room_Board').

## Data Visualization
- Visualized relationships between different features using scatter plots and histograms.
- Explored the distribution of 'Outstate' and 'Grad_Rate' for private and public colleges.

## Feature Engineering
- Transformed categorical columns ('ChestPain
